## Youth

### STUDENT SHACK
As all of us are aware: getting young children, who will all too soon be replacing many of us, interested in amateur radio needs to be a high priority.  To this end, the Stone Mountain Hamfest has, for years, brought a youth slant to our HamFest.  In fact, we may have been the birthplace of the movement to get youth involved.

With the increased emphasis on STEM in the schools, weâ€™re more involved than ever. STEM is the driving force behind our STUDENT SHACK 2021 Stone Mountain Hamfest.
