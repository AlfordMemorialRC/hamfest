### <a name="camping">CAMPING (ON SITE):</a>
RV, travel trailer, popup, and even regular tent sites are available at the Stone Mountain Hamfest. The restroom building is open 24-hours during the HamFest.  Any vehicle with people sleeping must have its "**HamFest Camping Sign**" visible at all times.  The cost for staying overnight is $20.00 per night (**ONLY** in your car, truck, or RV). Please make sure to indicate on the [registration form](general-hamfest-registration) if you are camping.

Each campsite has 50 amp shore-power and a water spigot.  There are 45 *back-in* RV spaces. The spaces are gravel mixed with some pavement and a hard grassy surface. Each campsite is wide enough to extend your RV awning. 

*This isnâ€™t a campground like a state park.*
