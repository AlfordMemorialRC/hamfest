All amateur examination applicants will be required to provide an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/getting-fcc-registration-number-frn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FCC Registration Number (FRN)</a> to the Volunteer Examiners (VEs) before taking an amateur exam. This is necessary due to changes the FCC has made to its licensing system. Amateur candidates who already have an FCC license, whether for amateur radio or in another service, already have an FRN and can use the same number. All prospective new FCC licensees, however, will be required to obtain an FRN before the examination and provide that number to the volunteer examiners on the Form 605 license application. An <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/rofrn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FCC instructional video</a> provides step-by-step instructions on how to obtain an FRN through the FCC’s COmmission REgistration System (CORES). 

There is no charge to enter the HamFest if you are **ONLY** coming to take an exam, but we would like you to stay and enjoy the Hamfest after your exam.  So using the honor system, if you plan on staying you are more than encouraged to purchase an admission ticket to help support Georgia’s largest HamFest.
